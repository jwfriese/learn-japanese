"Get me that thing"

Requirements:
- Two people
- Two tables/surfaces to put stuff on
- Each person gets some stuff to put on "their" table/surface
- Some kind of divider to obscure the tables/surfaces from the two people whenever they are not actively seeking an item

Rules 1:
- No English
- One player asks the other player to get them something off of "their" table/surface
- The asker just says the thing they want -- do not make it a full sentence

Rules 2:
- Same as "Rules 1", except now the asker may ask for something that's not there. The seeker must return and express that they could not find it.

Rules 3: 
- Same as either "Rules 1" or "Rules 2", except now the asker must ask in a complete sentence. 

Rules 4:
- Same as "Rules 3", except now the seeker chooses an "expression" card that displays an emotion that the asker must use when asking for the thing (i.e. kindly, politely, dickishly, etc.)
